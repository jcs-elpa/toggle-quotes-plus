This is much of the universal solution, it just simply toggle and cycle through the 
`quotes` you specify under `toggle-quotes-plus-chars` list in any file. 

This package search for the character that can be cycled in both `backward` and 
`forward` directions. The original `toggle-quotes` will only works in string so 
it will not work in `.html` or `.md` file type. 

For escape character, I couldn't figure out the best way to resolve this. Currently, 
this package will just ignore the escape character. If you have an idea to solve this 
you can open an `issue` or `pull request`, both methods are welcome.
